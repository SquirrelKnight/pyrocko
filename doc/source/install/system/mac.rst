Installation on Mac OS X systems
================================

On the Mac, several different package managers are available to ease the
installation of popular open source software tools and libraries. `Anaconda
<https://www.anaconda.com/>`_, `MacPorts <https://www.macports.org/>`_, `Fink
<http://www.finkproject.org/>`_, and `HomeBrew <https://brew.sh/>`_ are among
the most popular choices. To prevent trouble, pick one and stay with one.
